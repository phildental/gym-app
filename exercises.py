    "How to Do It": """
•	Sit on the edge of a horizontally oriented weight bench, and place a set of dumbbells on your lap.
•	Kick the weights back, shift your shoulder blades onto the bench, and press the weights straight up. Drive your shoulders into the bench to "set" them, then squeeze your glutes and abs to form a bridge shape with your feet planted on the ground.
•	Open your arms to lower your elbows down to the bench, forming the shape of the letter T. Focus on the eccentric portion of the movement, taking 3 to 4 seconds to lower.
•	Then, squeeze your chest to fly the weights back up.

    """,

    "Instructions": """
1. Start by sitting on a bench with the dumbbells resting on your thighs.
2. Kick the weights back and shift your shoulder blades onto the bench.
3. Drive your arms straight over your shoulders, maintaining a slight angle at the elbows.
4. Drive your shoulders into the bench to set your shoulder blades and protect your shoulders.
5. Squeeze your glutes and engage your abs to maintain a straight line from knees to shoulders without arching your back.
6. Open up your elbows and slowly lower the dumbbells down, focusing on a controlled eccentric contraction for about 3-4 seconds.
7. Fly the dumbbells back up, bringing them directly above your shoulders.
8. Repeat for 10-12 reps, focusing on the eccentric contraction and controlling the weight throughout the movement.
9. Rest for about 60 seconds between sets and perform 3 sets in total.

    
    """,

    "Pro Tips": """
- Maintain proper form and control throughout the exercise to protect your shoulders.
- Focus on the eccentric contraction by slowing down the lowering phase of the fly.
- Use heavier weights for an overload eccentric contraction by pressing the weights back up instead of flying them up.
- Start with higher reps (10-12) and gradually decrease reps (4-6) as you advance and trust yourself with heavier weights.
- Incorporate this exercise as a third or fourth exercise in a chest workout or superset it with back exercises.
- Take about 60 seconds of rest between sets to recover properly.

    •	This hypertrophy method means you're more focused on building muscle than pressing max weight, so keep your butt on the bench, with your feet flat on the floor and your glutes and core engaged. You should also drive your shoulder blades down into the bench.
    •	Lift your dumbbells up, squeezing the handles tightly. Once your back is on the bench, don't just hold the weights with your elbows parallel to your shoulders.
    •	Keep your elbows at a 45-degree angle to help to keep your shoulders safe.
    •	Squeeze your chest to drive the weight up, then lower under control under the same path to just above your chest.
